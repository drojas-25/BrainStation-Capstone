# BrainStation-Capstone
This is my capstone for the duration of the bootcamp at BrainStation

he Problem area: What is your area of interest? Within it, what challenges or
opportunities could your project address?
My primary area of interest lies in traveling. The key challenge I've identified from personal
experience is the difficulty in efficiently planning trips to specific cities while ensuring the
activities align with personal preferences. Currently, travelers rely on generic resources such as
guidebooks, websites, and social media, which often offer generic recommendations, leading
to overcrowding at popular attractions. These resources also may not accurately represent
local culture. So, my project aims to develop a solution that provides personalized
recommendations for travelers based on their preferences and past travel history, ultimately
enhancing the discoverability of cities and countries.

The User: Who experiences these problems? How would they benefit from the
outcomes of your project?
These problems primarily affect travelers who prefer to plan ahead or are unfamiliar with the
destination they are visiting. Particularly individuals from countries like the United States, where
vacation time is limited, and feel pressure to maximize their travel experiences. Having a
system that understands travelers' preferences can significantly streamline the trip-planning
process, ensuring they make the most of their time and enjoy tailored experiences.

The Big Idea: How can machine learning bring solutions to these areas? Research
how other people have approached the problem previously. Refer to the "Intro to
Capstone" slides on synapse for an overview of different machine learning
approaches.
Machine learning, I think, will be perfect for addressing these challenges by leveraging existing
traveler data to make personalized recommendations. While the specific methodology is yet to
be determined, an unsupervised machine-learning approach seems suitable for identifying
patterns and clustering travelers based on their preferences and behaviors. However, as
mentioned in class, I’ll be flexible in exploring other approaches that best suit the available
data.

The Impact: What societal or business value do you anticipate your project to add? If
possible, try to quantify the scale of the problem (in dollars, in CO2, in time spent, …)
According to WTC.org, tourism contributes 7.6% to global GDP. By offering personalized
recommendations and diverting tourist traffic from overcrowded attractions to lesser-known
gems, the solution aims to distribute tourism more evenly across destinations. This
redistribution can benefit smaller businesses and attractions, stimulating local economies
through increased foot traffic and revenue. Even a modest improvement in travel planning
efficiency could translate into substantial economic gains, surpassing the cited 7.6% figure.
